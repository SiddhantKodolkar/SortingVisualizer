## Visualization of Sorting Algorithm

### Introduction

●Visualization of sorting algorithm is a form of high level dynamic visualization

● It uses user interface techniques to portray and monitor the computational steps of algorithm

● Sorting algorithms carries out a vital undertaking that puts data of a list in a specific request or
organizes a compilation of items into a specific request

● Algorithm visualization illustrates how algorithms work in a graphical way

● It mainly aims to simplify and deepen the understanding of algorithm operations
