# SE Mini Project
## Visualization of Sorting Algorithms

### Introduction

●Visualization of sorting algorithm is a form of high level dynamic visualization

● It uses user interface techniques to portray and monitor the computational steps of algorithm

● Sorting algorithms carries out a vital undertaking that puts data of a list in a specific request or
organizes a compilation of items into a specific request

● Algorithm visualization illustrates how algorithms work in a graphical way

● It mainly aims to simplify and deepen the understanding of algorithm operations


### User Interface

#### Before Sorting

#### After Sorting

The input is generated randomly ,the user has to select any of the sorting algorithms:

1)Bubble Sort: Swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order,the algorithm needs one whole pass without any swaps to know if the array is sorted.

2)Selection Sort:Sort by repeatedly finding the minimum element and putting it at the beginning. It Maintains two arrays:sorted and unsorted arrays.In every iteration,the minimum element is pickedand moved to the sorted array

3)Merge Sort:It uses divide and conquer algorithm.Divide input array into two halves,it divides the input array into two halves and and merges the two halves 

4)Insertion Sort:The algorithm splits the array into sorted and unsorted part,values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
